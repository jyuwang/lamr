/-- Keeps track of an equivalence relation on a type `α`,
or equivalently a partition of `α` into disjoint subsets,
using Tarjan's union-find algorithm.
Any two equivalence classes can be merged into a larger one,
and for any `a : α` it is possible to find the canonical representative of `[a]`.
Thus equivalence of two elements `a b : α` can be checked easily
by reducing it to a comparison on the representatives of `[a]` and `[b]`.
There can be at most finitely many non-singleton equivalence classes.

Note that to achieve the desired amortized time complexity,
`DisjointSetWithProofs` has to compress paths while performing "read-only" operations,
so these operations actually return a new version of the structure
which should be used instead from then on.
`DisjointSetWithProofs` should be used linearly, i.e.,
it should have a reference count of 1 at all times.

The behaviour is unspecified if `BEq α` is not a `LawfulBEq α`. -/
